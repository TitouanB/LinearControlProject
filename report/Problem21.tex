In order to design a discrete time Kalman filter for the previous model, the first step is to discretize the covariance matrix $V_{nd}$. As the smallest constant time of the system is bigger than the $T_{s}$, we can discretize it as following:
\begin{equation*}
Q = B_{va}V_{nd}B_{va}^T T_s
\end{equation*}
Moreover the measurement noise in discrete is: $\sigma_{n_{2}d} = \frac{\sigma_{n_2}}{T_s}$.
Then we use \emph{dlqe} to design the Kalman Filter:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Matlab]
[M,P,Z,E] = dlqe(Fa,Gva,Ca,Q,sigman2d);
\end{lstlisting}
However, the \emph{dlqe} function of MATLAB does not accept these matrices because $Q$ must be square with as many columns as $B_{va}$. As the first three rows of $B_{va}$ are nul, we remove them to compute Q.
