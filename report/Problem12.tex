We now want to discretize the continuous time linear model. As the smallest constant time is $\tau_2=0.0013\ s$, we will choose a sampling time $T_s=0.0001\ s$, that is to say 10 times faster. However, this sampling time is the $STEP\_SIZE$ of the simulation, so the sampling time should be different. Therefore, we will choose $T_s=0.0002\ s$.

Then, we can discretize the linear system using $c2d$ MATLAB function.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Matlab]
Ts=0.0002; %[s]
[F,G]=c2d(A, B, Ts);
[F, Gd] = c2d(A, Bd, Ts);
lambdad=eig(F);
\end{lstlisting}

The eigenvalues, $\lambda_1=0.9426$, $\lambda_2=0.8869+0.0864i$ and $\lambda_3=0.8869-0.0864i$, of the discrete time system are inside the unit circle, which means that the system is still asymptotically stable. This result was expected because a discrete time system with a well chosen sampling time is supposed to have the same behavior and be the same system.
