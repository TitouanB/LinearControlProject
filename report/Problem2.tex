The block diagram of the nonlinear model figure \ref{fig:figP2} in Appendix \ref{AppP2} shows how the electrical and the mechanical subsystems are interconnected. This block diagram is also our SIMULINK model. The system is quickly stabilised (around 1 s) but as we are going to analyse it in the frequency domain, a longer period of time will provide better results. Thus, the TIME\_SIM is set to 5 s.
