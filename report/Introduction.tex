The purpose of this compulsory exercise which consists of designing a controller with a Kalman Filter to attenuate the harmonic distortion of a loudspeaker, is to practice the topics learned in the Control Linear Design 2 course 31310. To do so, we will use several methods, such as linearisation of the non linear model, discretisations of the different systems at each step in order to design a discrete controller, as well as a Kalman Filter. The state space model will also be augmented to include the fictitious noise. All the implementations will be carried out in Matlab and SIMULINK.

We have solved each problem together. Thus, the participation of each member is 50-50 \%.
