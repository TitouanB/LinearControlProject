Two different approaches were carried out to control the loudspeakers and attenuate the harmonic distortion. The first one consists in adding a disturbance to simulate the second and third order harmonic distortion to the linearised model of the loudspeakers. Then a discrete reference feedforward controller has been designed using this augmented model. This controller works well, the input reference is well followed, even if the amplitude of the state is a bit too low when the frequencies are close to the maximum of 200 Hz. Indeed, the constraint of the maximum voltage (40 V) of $u_e$ imposed us a maximum gain for our controller.

Then, the other approach was using a Kalman filter. However, even if the model has been augmented with the disturbance and the different noises and a discrete Kalman filter designed for this new model, the simulation is not conclusive and we cannot neither implement a new controller using this filter and evaluate its performances nor compare it to the first controller.
